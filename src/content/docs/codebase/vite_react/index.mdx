This codebase has a basic setup. First, clone this repository to your machine and follow these steps:

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

export const yarnInstall = `
yarn install
`;

export const yarnRun = `
yarn run dev
`;

<Code code={yarnInstall} lang="js" />

<Code code={yarnRun} lang="js" />

###### Code Quality Tools:

1. **ESLint**: Throws errors for issues like unused variables, syntax errors, and code format problems.
2. **Prettier**: Formats the code.
3. **Husky**: Checks commits for ESLint errors and blocks the commit until errors are fixed.

###### Folder structure:

• **api**: It contains three files:

    1. **appAxios.js**: Used for a custom Axios instance for making HTTP requests with specific  configurations.
    2. **config.js**: Contains backend host URLs based on the environment.
    3. **url.js**: Defines backend endpoints

• **assets**: Store all image files and other media assets used in the project.

• **components**: Create reusable UI components to be used throughout the application, promoting modularity and consistency.

• **constant**: Store static data such as constants, configuration settings, and other data that doesn't change during runtime.

• **hooks**: Create custom React hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and stateful behavior, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

• **layout**: Create the root layout component which serves as the main structural component, typically wrapping around page components and providing a consistent layout.

• **pages**: Create UI pages, such as the Home Page, About Page, etc. Each page represents a distinct view in the application.

• **routes**: Define routes based on the pages, e.g., Home routes. This folder helps manage the navigation structure and provides examples of how to set up routes.

• **store**: Create global state management using the Zustand library. This folder contains state management logic that can be accessed and updated from anywhere in the application. For more details, check this [link](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction).

• **utils**: Create common utility functions that can be used across different parts of the application, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
