title: Vite + React Js
description: Basic setup
---

#### Getting Started

To set up this project on your local machine, clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Cyces-Innovation-Labs/vite-react_boilerplate) and follow these steps:

Remove the existing remote if you have cloned the repository from a different source:

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

export const gitRemoteRemove = `
git remote remove origin
`;

<Code code={gitRemoteRemove} lang="js" />

Add your repository as the new origin:

export const gitRemoteAdd = `
git remote add origin **your repo**
`;

<Code code={gitRemoteAdd} lang="js" />

Push to your repository:

export const gitPush = `
git push -u origin main
`;

<Code code={gitPush} lang="js" />

Install the dependencies:

export const yarnInstall = `
yarn install
`;

<Code code={yarnInstall} lang="js" />
Run the development server:

export const yarnRun = `yarn run dev`;

<Code code={yarnRun} lang="js" />

###### Installed Libraries:

• **Axios**: Axios is a popular promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests in the browser. For more information, visit the [Axios documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

• **Zustand**: Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React applications, offering a straightforward API for managing application state. For more information, visit the [Zustand documentation](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction).

###### Mandatory Libraries:

• **Material-UI (MUI)**: MUI offers a comprehensive set of UI components that are highly customizable and easy to use. For more information, visit the [MUI documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).

Note: Some UI designs may reference other UI libraries. Refer to those specific libraries if mentioned; otherwise, default to using MUI for the project's UI needs.

• **React Helmet**: React Helmet is a reusable React component that manages changes to the document head. It enables adding meta tags, link tags, and scripts to the application's HTML head section. For more information, visit the [React Helmet documentation](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet#readme).

• **React Query**: React Query is a data fetching and caching library for React applications. It provides tools for managing asynchronous data fetching and synchronization with the UI state. For more information, visit the [React Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

###### Code Quality Tools:

This project uses the following tools to ensure code quality:

1. **ESLint**: Throws errors for issues like unused variables, syntax errors, and code format problems.
2. **Prettier**: Formats the code.
3. **Husky**: Checks commits for ESLint errors and blocks the commit until errors are fixed.

###### Folder structure:

• **api**: It contains three files:

    1. **appAxios.js**: Used for a custom Axios instance for making HTTP requests with specific  configurations.
    2. **config.js**: Contains backend host URLs based on the environment.
    3. **url.js**: Defines backend endpoints

• **assets**: Store all image files and other media assets used in the project.

• **components**: Create reusable UI components to be used throughout the application, promoting modularity and consistency.

• **constant**: Store static data such as constants, configuration settings, and other data that doesn't change during runtime.

• **hooks**: Create custom React hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and stateful behavior, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

• **layout**: Create the root layout component which serves as the main structural component, typically wrapping around page components and providing a consistent layout.

• **pages**: Create UI pages, such as the Home Page, About Page, etc. Each page represents a distinct view in the application.

• **routes**: Define routes based on the pages, e.g., Home routes. This folder helps manage the navigation structure and provides examples of how to set up routes.

• **store**: Create global state management using the Zustand library. This folder contains state management logic that can be accessed and updated from anywhere in the application.

• **utils**: Create common utility functions that can be used across different parts of the application, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
